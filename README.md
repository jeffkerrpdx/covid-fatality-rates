# Covid Fatality Rates  

## Ask
Question: How have Covid Fatality Rates changed in the U.S. since the beginning of the pandemic, and what is the current case fatality rate and the infection fatality rate?

This question is important because if the Covid fatality rate is decreasing, this may indicate it is less of a danger than it was 2 years ago.  It also may indicate that Covid is becoming more of an "endemic" disease like influenza, and its danger to the public may becoming more similar to other endemic diseases, such as influenza.
